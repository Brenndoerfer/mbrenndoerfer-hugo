# Profile

Michael Brenndoerfer is a full-stack engineer and passionated about data and machine learning. He graduated 2018 with a Masterâ€™s in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences from the University of California, Berkeley, where he primarily worked on data science and deep learning related topics, such as model optimization, and applications of deep learning in the financial space. The title of his thesis was "Model Selection Algorithm for Meta-Learning" and is part of the DARPA Data-driven Discovery of Models (D3M) project. He was advised by Prof. Dawn Song and Mitar Milutinovic.

During his time at UC Berkeley, he co-founded Cryptonite Technologies, Inc., a crypto-asset brokerage and portfolio management platform, where he initially served as CTO, and then CEO.

Prior to getting his graduate degree, he worked several years for IBM Research in labs all over the world. His work evolved around distributed systems, machine and deep learning, as well as cloud infrastructure solutions. He holds an undergraduate degree in Computer Science from the DHBW Stuttgart and is the co-author of multiple research papers in the space of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Michael was part of the 2016/ 17 German American Conference at Harvard organization committee. He now works as Senior Software Engineer at Fitbit (Health Solutions) in Boston, MA.

Michael is excited about getting to know and being involved in business endeavors that relate to his interests: data science, machine learning, and building (software) systems. He is particularly interested in the finance, politics, real estate, and the food space. He also loves to cycle and lift heavy weights.
